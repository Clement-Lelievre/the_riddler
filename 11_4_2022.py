# The end of daylight saving time here on the East Coast of the U.S. got me thinking more generally about the calendar year.
# Each solar year consists of approximately 365.24217 mean solar days. Thatâ€™s pretty close to 365.25, which is why it makes sense
# to have an extra day every four years. However, the Gregorian calendar is a little more precise: There are 97 leap years every 400 years,
# averaging out to 365.2425 days per year.

# Can you make a better approximation than the Gregorian calendar? Find numbers L and N (where N is less than 400) such that if
# every cycle of N years includes L leap years, the average number of days per year is as close as possible to 365.24217.
