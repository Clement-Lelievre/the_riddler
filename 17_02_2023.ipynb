    "There’s a version of solitaire played in southern Italy with a deck of 40 Neapolitan cards, with `four suits numbered from 1 to 10`. The deck is shuffled and then cards are turned over one at a time. Flipping over the first card you say “one,” the second card “two” and the third card “three.” You repeat this, saying “one” for the fourth card, “two” for the fifth card and “three” for the sixth card. You continue your way through the deck, until you at last say “one” for the 40th card.\n",
