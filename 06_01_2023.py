# You and a friend are shooting some hoops at your local basketball court when she issues a challenge:
# She will name a number, which weâ€™ll call N. Your goal is to score exactly N points in as many ways as possible
# using only 2-point and 3-point shots. The order of your shots does not matter.

# For example, there are two ways you could score N = 8 points: four 2-pointers or two 3-pointers and one 2-pointer.

# Your apparently sadistic friend chooses 60 for the value of N. You try to negotiate this number down, but to no avail.
# However, she says you are welcome to pick an even larger value of N. Does there exist an integer N greater than 60 such that
# there are fewer ways to score N points than there are ways to score 60 points?
